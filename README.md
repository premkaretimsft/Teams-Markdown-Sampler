# Team Markdwon Sampler

Microsoft Teams agent to send markdown content to client bypassing backend checks that normally convert the markdown in message content to html. These changes won't work by themself but need to be matched with custom client code to see the result on client.

## Setup

1. **Sign into Teams Toolkit extension** in VS Code with your Microsoft 365 account

2. **Update environment configuration** - Configure your .env.local file with required API keys and settings

3. **Run the application** - Use Teams Toolkit to start and deploy the app to Teams

That's it! Once deployed, you can start interacting with the agent to send raw markdown in messages.
